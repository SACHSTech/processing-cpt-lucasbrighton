# LB FPS Shooter

The goal of this game is to shoot as many moving targets in the two levels we have created as possible within a 60-second timeframe. It is for the user to have an arcade-style gaming experience with minimal animation and simple graphics, and can also be used as an aim trainer for people who are interested in getting better at mouse and keyboard video games. The game boots up to a menu screen, allowing them to choose between 3 different options: level 1, 2, and leaderboard. The two levels are played by the user moving their mouse around the screen to click on the targets found on images drawn on the screen. In level one, a forest setting, the user shoots at sheep walking around the ground. In level two, a space setting, the user shoots at UFOs flying around the screen in random locations. When the user hits the targets, they are awarded points. 100 for each hit in level one, and 200 for each hit in level 2. This is because level 2 is much harder, as the speeds and direction of travel are both randomized, as opposed to the constant linear motion and set speed of level 1. After one minute, the level is over, and their points are added up. The userâ€™s accuracy is displayed along with their score, these scores are then stored on the leaderboard, and the user has the option to return to the menu screen to try the other level, replay, or take a look at he leaderboard. If the user decides to open the leaderboard, they will see the top 5 scores that have been obtained, with the corresponding accuracy. As far as limitations go, there are no limitations found in the code, as it has been scoured for sources of error.
